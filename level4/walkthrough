# level4

- Same thing as the previous level

- This time we split the print in 2 because it take to much time to write 16930116 char at once

- So 21820 char the first time to put `0x0005544`

- We have an offest of 30 so we need to substract and write 43966 other char to write `0x10102` at global_var + 2 so only the 4 first byte is writen to the global var

- Now we have the value `0x1025544` = 16930116 in our global var and this pass the check

- ```sh
  python /tmp/level4.py | ./level4
  ```

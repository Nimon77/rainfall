sizeof(this) = 0x6c = 108
this+0x6c = this00-4

| this (size 0x6c) | |  this00 (size 0x6c)  |
| func | buff | id | | func  |  buff   | id |
|   4  |  100 |  4 |4|   4   |  100    | 4  |
|      |AAAAAA|AAAA|A|804a078|shellcode|    |
|      |     0x6c    |                      |

writing "A"*6c at this->buf (this+4)
writing this00->buff addr to this->func
writing shellcode to this00->buff

so when this00->func is call it execute shellcode at this->buff

# level3

- We can exploit the vulnerable printf to write to the global var with `%n`

- The var is at `0x0804988c`

- We need to write 64 char to pass the check

- We when testing with multiple `%x` we see that our first char is 4 arg after printf so we need to put `4*%x` for the %n to write at the addr that we put at the start of the string

- ```sh
  (python /tmp/level3.py;cat) | ./level3
  ```
